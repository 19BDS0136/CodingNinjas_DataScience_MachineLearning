# CodingNinjas: Data Science and Machine Learning Course
This repository contains my Jupyter notebook notes for the said course by [CodingBlocks](https://github.com/coding-blocks).

I have tried to write notebooks in a way that they are sufficient on their basics of Python, Machine Learning and Data Science.
